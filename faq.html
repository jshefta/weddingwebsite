        <h3>What's the dress code?</h3>
        <p>Our dress code is cocktail attire. Guests are welcome to dress festive for the New Years as well (sparkles!).</p>

        <h3>Can my kids come?</h3>
        <p>We love your kids but think this event is best suited for grown-ups.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>I have dietary restrictions. What kind of food will be served?</h3>
        <p>The dinner will be family-style Chinese banquet, with a large variety of meats, seafood, vegetables and rice. If you have specific needs that we should be aware of, text us so we can accomodate you.</p>

        <h3>I'm concerned about traffic in NYC on NYE.</h3>
        <p>NYC absolutely has more traffic than usual on NYE. To ensure you don't get caught up in the mess, we suggest the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Stay beneath 37th street on the 31st as street closures around Times Square begin early in the day.</li>
          <li>Take the subway when possible. It will be faster and cheaper than taking a car and runs regularly even on holidays like NYE.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Will there be transportation?</h3>
        <p>We will have transportation from the Synagogue to Golden Unicorn via coach bus. If you are planning to go to the After-Party, we recommend walking as it is 0.1 miles away or a ~3 min walk (just across the Bowery).</p>
